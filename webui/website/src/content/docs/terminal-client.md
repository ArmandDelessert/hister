## Global Flags

These flags are available on every command:

| Flag                       | Description                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--config PATH`            | Path to config file (default: `./config.yml`, `~/.histerrc`, or `~/.config/hister/config.yml`)  |
| `--server-url URL` / `-u`  | Hister server URL (overrides `server.base_url` from config)                                     |
| `--token TOKEN` / `-t`     | Access token for server authentication (overrides `app.access_token` from config)               |
| `--log-level LEVEL` / `-l` | Log level: `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, `trace` (default: `info`)                       |
| `--search-url URL` / `-s`  | Default search engine URL with `{query}` placeholder                                            |
| `--client-timeout N`       | HTTP client timeout in seconds for server communication (0 = no timeout; default if unset: 10s) |

Example: index a slow extractor (e.g. `yt-dlp` with a longer timeout:

```bash
hister --client-timeout 20 index https://example.com
```

## Command-Line Usage

View all available commands:

```bash
./hister help
```

### Index a URL Manually

To manually index a specific URL:

```bash
./hister index https://example.com
```

To index URLs from a file, put one URL on each line and use `--url-list`:

```bash
hister index --url-list urls.txt
```

Empty lines are ignored. If positional URLs are also supplied, Hister ignores
them and indexes only the URLs from the file.

By default, Hister fetches the page using a plain HTTP request. For JavaScript-heavy pages
you can switch to a headless Chrome backend with `--backend`:

```bash
hister index --backend chromedp https://example.com
```

If the Chromium binary is not on your `PATH`, point to it with `--backend-option`:

```bash
hister index --backend chromedp --backend-option exec_path=/usr/bin/chromium https://example.com
```

You can also pass extra headers or cookies for the request:

```bash
hister index --header "Accept-Language=en" --cookie "session=abc; Domain=example.com" https://example.com
```

The crawler configuration from your config file (`crawler.backend`, `crawler.backend_options`, etc.)
is used as the default; all flags override or extend those values per invocation.

### Exporting Documents

Use `hister export` to write indexed documents to a JSON file. This is useful for
backups or for moving documents between Hister instances. By default every indexed
document is exported:

```bash
hister export backup.json
```

You can limit the export to documents matching a search query by passing it after the
output file (see the [query language](query-language) reference):

```bash
hister export rust.json "rust lang:en"
```

Each document is written as a single JSON line; lines that do not start with `{` are
structural markers (`[`, `]`, `,`) and can be safely skipped by parsers. Pass `-` as the
output file to write to standard output instead, which can be piped into other tools:

```bash
hister export | gzip > backup.json.gz
```

Use `--start-date` / `--end-date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to only export documents whose `updated`
timestamp falls within the given date range. The resulting file can be re-imported with
`hister import` (see below).

### Importing Documents

Use `hister import` to add documents from files on disk. It accepts an arbitrary
number of files or directories, which are imported in order and reported as a
combined total:

```bash
hister import export.json page.html ~/Downloads/saved-pages
```

Three input formats are supported, detected by file extension:

- **JSON export files** files previously created by `hister export`. They are read
  line by line and each document is submitted to the running server, where its content
  is re-processed from the stored HTML.
- **7z archives** (`.7z`) a 7z-compressed archive containing a single JSON export file.
- **HTML files** (`.html` or `.htm`) a saved web page. The document URL is extracted
  from the HTML itself (the `<link rel="canonical">` tag, OpenGraph/Twitter `url` meta
  tags, etc.) and the page is submitted to the running server for processing. The import
  fails for a given file if the HTML cannot be parsed or no URL can be found in it.

When a directory is passed, Hister imports matching `.json`, `.7z`, `.html`, and `.htm`
files directly inside that directory in filename order. Other files and nested
directories are ignored.

```bash
# Import a single saved web page
hister import ~/Downloads/article.html

# Import all supported files directly inside a directory
hister import ~/Downloads/saved-pages
```

Useful flags:

- `--skip-existing` do not overwrite documents that are already in the index.
- `--start-date` / `--end-date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) only import documents whose `added`
  timestamp falls within the given date range (applies to JSON exports).
- `--batch-size` controls how many documents are submitted in each bulk request.
  The default is `10` and the maximum is `100`.

> **Note:** `hister import` talks to a running Hister server, so make sure the server
> is started before importing. To bulk-import browsing history instead, see
> [Importing Browser History](importing-browser-history).

### Crawling Websites

Use `--recursive` (`-r`) to recursively crawl a website starting from a given URL.
Every crawl runs as a **persistent job** backed by the database, so it can be interrupted
and resumed at any time without losing progress.

#### Start a crawl

```bash
hister index -r https://example.com
```

A random job ID is generated and printed when the crawl starts. Keep it if you want to
resume later.

#### Specify your own job ID

```bash
hister index -r --job-id my-docs https://example.com/docs
```

#### Resume an interrupted crawl

Pass the same `--job-id` without any URL arguments:

```bash
hister index --job-id my-docs
```

Hister restores the original validator rules and picks up exactly where it left off.

#### Limit the crawl scope

| Flag                | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--max-depth N`     | Stop following links deeper than N levels (0 = no limit) |
| `--max-links N`     | Stop after visiting N pages in total (0 = no limit)      |
| `--allowed-domain`  | Only follow links on this domain (repeatable)            |
| `--exclude-domain`  | Never follow links on this domain (repeatable)           |
| `--allowed-pattern` | Only follow URLs matching this regexp (repeatable)       |
| `--exclude-pattern` | Skip URLs matching this regexp (repeatable)              |

#### Select a scraping backend

Both recursive and non-recursive `index` support the same backend flags:

| Flag                        | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--backend NAME`            | Scraping backend: `http` (default) or `chromedp` (headless Chrome)                                                   |
| `--backend-option KEY=VAL`  | Backend-specific option (repeatable). See [configuration](configuration#crawler-backend-options) for available keys. |
| `--header KEY=VALUE`        | Extra HTTP request header (repeatable, e.g. `--header Accept-Language=en`)                                           |
| `--cookie SET-COOKIE-VALUE` | Cookie in Set-Cookie format (repeatable, e.g. `--cookie "session=abc; Domain=example.com"`)                          |

These flags override or extend the corresponding `crawler.*` values from your config file for the duration of the command. Headers and cookies are merged with any values already defined in the config file.

Example: crawl a JavaScript-heavy site with Chromium:

```bash
hister index -r \
  --backend chromedp \
  --backend-option exec_path=/usr/bin/chromium \
  https://example.com
```

Example: crawl only the docs subdomain, up to 200 pages:

```bash
hister index -r \
  --job-id docs-crawl \
  --allowed-domain docs.example.com \
  --max-links 200 \
  https://docs.example.com
```

### Managing Crawl Jobs

Use the `crawl` command to inspect and clean up persistent crawl jobs.

#### List all jobs

```bash
hister crawl list
```

Output shows the job ID, status (`running`, `completed`, `interrupted`), start URL, and
per-status URL counts (pending, done, failed, skipped).

#### Show job details

```bash
hister crawl show my-docs
```

This shows the job status, start URL, saved crawler rules, and per-status URL counts.
To print only failed URLs with their stored error codes:

```bash
hister crawl errors my-docs
```

#### List queued URLs

```bash
hister crawl queue my-docs
```

This prints every URL row tracked by the job as tab-separated status, depth, and URL fields.
Use `-c` or `--count` to print only the number of tracked URL rows:

```bash
hister crawl queue my-docs --count
```

#### Delete a job

```bash
hister crawl delete my-docs
```

This removes the job record and all associated URL tracking data from the database.
The documents that were already indexed are not affected.

## TUI (Terminal UI)

Hister provides a terminal-based user interface for searching your browsing history without leaving your terminal.

### Start the TUI

Run the search command without any arguments:

```bash
hister search
```

### TUI Features

**TUI config location**: `~/.config/hister/tui.yaml`

#### tui.yaml Structure

```yaml
# Theme settings
dark_theme: 'dracula'
light_theme: 'gruvbox'
color_scheme: 'auto'
# themes_dir: "/path/to/custom/themes"  # optional

# TUI keybindings
